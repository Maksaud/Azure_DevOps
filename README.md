# Azure_DevOps

## Introduction

This Repo is to try to use Azure tools to do DevOps.

## Tools
### Configuration management
For configuration management, I could not find any Azure tools for it so I will be using Ansible.

### Building an Image.
Just did some research and found that configuration management can be done through azure pipeline using a YAML file.
### CI CD
Use Azure Pipeline to start a CI/CD pipeline

You must link your github repo and azure will expect a YAML file that will be used to test on a container.
### Deployment
Still with Azure Pipelines, it is used to deploy.
## Using VNET
